Android application to control a strip of programmable leds. Final project of the subject of Mobile Applications.

# Ideas
- Use of the HC-05 bluetooth module and Arduino / Atmega;
- Writing an application for selecting the number of LEDs, selecting their colors, selecting lighting effects;
- Additional elements such as reading from sensors - make the lighting dependent on it, the use of the camera as well.
